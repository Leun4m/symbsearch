## What it is supposed to get...

With SymbSearch you can easily get the special unicode letter or symbol you need. You just need to type in the name of the letter e.g. "delta" and you get - voilá a "δ". You just need to press "ENTER" and so you have it in your clipboard. Pretty cool, isn't it?!

*The trick:* If you press "Delta" you get also the huge "Δ".
