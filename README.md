## About SymbSearch
With SymbSearch you can easily get the special unicode letter or symbol you need.
Also conversions from symbol to code (decimal, hexadecimal, HTML) and vice versa is possible.

## How it works

You just need to **type in** the name of the letter e.g. "delta" and you get - voilá a "Δ and δ". You just need to select the one you want (via `↑` | `↓`) and press `Enter` and so you have it in your clipboard. Pretty cool, isn't it?!
