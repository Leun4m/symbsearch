# SymbSearch ![logo][logo]

With SymbSearch you can easily get the special unicode letter or symbol you need.

## How it works

You just need to start the application and can **show** and **hide** the window about the **shortcut**.

Default it is `Ctrl` / `Cmd` + `Alt` + `W`, but in `config.json` you can edit your desired shortcut.  
The keys should have [this][1] format.

You just need to **type in** the name of the letter e.g. "delta" and you get - voilá a "Δ and δ". You just need to select the one you want (via `↑` | `↓`) and press `Enter` and so you have it in your clipboard. Pretty cool, isn't it?!

You can also **filter** through categories via `Alt`.

## Future ... what it is supposed to get ...

If you press "Delta" you get only the huge "Δ".
